 Different parts of the project are licensed under different terms.
 Here are the details.

 1] The "Coloring Book for iOS" source code is copyrighted by me and
    licensed under the GPL v2.0.

 2] The "Coloring Book for iOS" logo is copyrighted by me. All
    rights reserved.

    Forks may contain the logo, but the logo may not be used outside of
    the scope of forks (barring fair use).

 3] All images and media (binary files that are not software
    dependencies) not described in section 2 are licensed under the

 4] If you are not using the content described in section 3, you may
    ignore this section.

    Attribution specifications for the content described in section 3.

    The following specifications are automatically satisfied in
    repository forks which contain the supplied CREDITS file. Should you
    choose to not use the supplied CREDITS file or should your usage of
    the content fall outside the scope of forks (e.g., using an image on
    a website), then you must follow all specifications listed below.

    Attribution specifications:
 
     a] You must visually indicate that the content was created by
        "Byron Sanchez". A text credit is sufficient. If you make
        modifications to the work, then you must state that the original
        work was created by "Byron Sanchez".

     b] Link the text "Byron Sanchez" directly to the website:
     
        http://hackbytes.com

        A special exception to this applies to any form of distribution
        or publication in which a link is not technologically possible
        (e.g. a fork). If links are not technologically possible, simply
        place the url next to my name. Websites must actually use a
        standard HTML link.

     c] The attribution must be visible. In the case of websites, it
        must be visible even with JavaScript disabled. You may not use
        any form of redirection or obfuscation. Links must NOT be
        nofollowed.
